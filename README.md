  Egghead Examples for Using MDX
</h1>

This repository demonstrates how to install, configure, and use MDX. This repository uses a Gatsby site though the principles for application are relevant for any React app using MDX.

## 💫 Live Example Site

This example site can be seen live at [https://determined-poitras-cc2fcb.netlify.com/](https://determined-poitras-cc2fcb.netlify.com/).

## 🔧 Running locally

The site can be run locally on your own computer as well.

Clone the site, navigate into it, and start it up.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gillkyle/egghead-using-mdx.git

cd egghead-using-mdx

npm install

gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`, you can see the MDX example page at `http://localhost:8000/my-first-post`
